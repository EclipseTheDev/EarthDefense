# Earth Defence
Defend the Earth from the upcoming meteors! (WIP).

* [x] Ship movement
* [x] Canvas boundaries
* [x] Collision spaceship-meteor
* [x] Shooting
* [x] After a while shooting causes performance drop - FIXED
* [x] Collision spaceship bullets - meteor
* [x] Explosion image at the place where the meteor was destroyed
* [x] Score
* [x] Ship hits meteor - destroy meteor and deduct 20 HP(ONCE!) from the spaceship
* [x] End game if ship HP reaches 0.
* [x] Add a randomly spawned HP restoration and restore ship's HP if it collects it.
* [x] Explosion image when ship hits meteor.
* [x] Custom ship HP and earth HP progress bars.
* [x] End game if Earth is destroyed (earth HP reaches 0).
* [x] Exit button at game over menu takes you to the main menu.
* [x] Fix meteors and HP restoration spawning off canvas heights.
* [x] Stop ship going off boundaries.
* [x] Merged meteor destruction by ammo and by ship.

-------------------
* [ ]  Explosion image does not appears for every meteor hit. Sometimes it does, sometimes doesnt.
* [ ]  Canvas revamp (full window width and height?) ?
* [ ]  Adjust meteor speed after 6000 points. Currently way too fast.
* [ ]  Fix issue with rocket firing at the start of the game.
