# Earth Defense

Earth Defense is a remake of the classic Space shooter type of games, with 8-bit (pixel art) assets. This project used free assets (music and graphics) provided by [Jonathan So](https://jonathan-so.itch.io/),[KennyNL](https://kenney.nl/) and other sources, like Google images and [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org). This was a learning project. There will be some updates in the near future. Hope you like it, have fun!
