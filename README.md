# Earth Defence
Defend the Earth from the upcoming meteors! (WIP).

* [x] Ship movement
* [x] Canvas boundaries
* [x] Collision spaceship-meteor
* [x] Shooting
* [x] After a while shooting causes performance drop - FIXED
* [x] Collision spaceship bullets - meteor
* [x] Explosion image at the place where the meteor was destroyed
* [x] Score
* [x] Ship hits meteor - destroy meteor and deduct 20 HP(ONCE!) from the spaceship
* [x] End game if ship HP reaches 0.
* [x] Add a randomly spawned HP restoration and restore ship's HP if it collects it.
* [x] Explosion image when ship hits meteor.
* [x] Custom ship HP and earth HP progress bars.
* [x] End game if Earth is destroyed (earth HP reaches 0).
* [x] Exit button at game over menu takes you to the main menu.
* [x] Fix meteors and HP restoration spawning off canvas heights.
* [x] Stop ship going off boundaries.
* [x] Merged meteor destruction by ammo and by ship.
* [x] Add a randomly spawned comet / larger meteor which upon destruction gives you 500 points.
* [x] If the comet hits the meteor or the ship, decrease the HP by 40.
* [x] Sounds for shooting and meteor destruction.
* [x] Corrected ship movement. Now the ship moves as long as you hold the key, when you release the direction key it stops.
