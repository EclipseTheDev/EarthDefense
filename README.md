* [x] After a while shooting causes performance drop - FIXED
* [x] Collision spaceship bullets - meteor
* [x] Explosion image at the place where the meteor was destroyed
* [x] Score
* [x] ship hits meteor - destroy meteor and deduct 20 HP(ONCE!) from the spaceship
* [x] End game if ship HP reaches 0.
* [x]  Add a randomly spawned HP restoration and restore ship's HP if it collects it.
* [x]  Explosion image when ship hits meteor.

-------------------
* [ ]  More bullets to be up at the same time.
* [ ]  Explosion image does not appears for every meteor hit. Sometimes it does, sometimes doesnt.
* [ ]  Different game over menu image (RIP if dead, something else if "EARTH DEFENDED")
* [ ]  Add a randomly spawned comet / larger meteor which upon destruction gives you 500 points.
